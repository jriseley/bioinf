A Python package called `bioinf` implemented while completing the course [Biology Meets Programming: Bioinformatics for Beginners]([https://www.coursera.org/learn/bioinformatics/home/welcome]), hosted on Coursera and run by University of California, San Diego.  

This package contains my implementations of the functions described in this course.
